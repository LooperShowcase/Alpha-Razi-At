    <h1>Football</h1>
    
    <h2>
      Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees,
      kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally
      means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is
      used.

      The Laws of the Game are the codified rules of association football. The
      laws mention the number of players a team should have, the game length,
      the size of the field and ball, the type and nature of fouls that referees
      may penalise, the offside law, and many other laws that define the sport.
      During a match, it is the task of the referee to interpret and enforce the
      Laws of the Game. There were various attempts to codify rules among the
      various types of football in the mid-19th century. The extant Laws date
      back to 1863 where a ruleset was formally adopted by the newly formed
      Football Association (FA) and written by its first secretary, Ebenezer
      Cobb Morley. Over time, the Laws have been amended, and since 1886 they
      have been maintained by the International Football Association Board
      (IFAB). The Laws are the only rules of association football FIFA permits
      its members to use.[1] The Laws currently allow some minor optional
      variations which can be implemented by national football associations,
      including some for play at the lowest levels, but otherwise almost all
      organised football worldwide is played under the same ruleset. Within the
      United States, Major League Soccer used a distinct ruleset during the
      1990s[2] and the National Federation of State High School Associations and
      National Collegiate Athletic Association still use rulesets that are
      comparable to, but different from, the IFAB Laws.

      Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (Spanish pronunciation: [reˈal maˈðɾið ˈkluβ ðe
      ˈfuðβol] ⓘ), commonly referred to as Real Madrid, is a Spanish
      professional football club based in Madrid. The club competes in La Liga,
      the top tier of Spanish football. Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club,
      the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The
      honorific title real is Spanish for "royal" and was bestowed to the club
      by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem.
      Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 83,186-capacity Santiago
      Bernabéu in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting
      entities, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club
      throughout its history. The official Madrid anthem is the "Hala Madrid y
      nada más", written by RedOne and Manuel Jabois.[6] The club is one of the
      most widely supported in the world, and is the most followed football club
      on social media according to the CIES Football Observatory as of
      2023[7][8] and was estimated to be worth $5.1 billion in 2022, making it
      the world's most valuable football club.[9] In 2023, it was the second
      highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of
      €713.8 million.[10]
